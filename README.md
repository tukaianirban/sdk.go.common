# A collection of useful libraries

This repository contains a collection of useful libraries that I have been building over time. The libraries are used across my private Golang projects.
I hope you find joy in using them as much as I do.
Each package is meant to be standalone and does not have dependencies on other packages.

## Using the module

- Get the available versions of the module using `go list -m -versions github.com/tukaianirban/sdk.go.common`

- Fetch the latest version of the module using `go get github.com/tukaianirban/sdk.go.common`

## Contributions

- All requests for contributing to the project are welcome.
- File a Pull Request, detailing the `problem` and the `solution`.
- - All contributions must come from feature branches, named after the problem being resolved.
- - Look for constructive review of your change. Every Pull Request must be reviewed by atleast one other person for sanity, cleanliness and value.
- - If you are reviewing a PR, be kind to the developer/contributor, but not to the code.

## Feedback

- If you find the module to be useful, do consider `star`ing it.
- If you are looking to provide feedback, feel free to reach out.
