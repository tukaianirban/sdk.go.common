# A collection of useful libraries

This repository contains a collection of useful libraries that I have been building over time. The libraries are used across my private Golang projects.
I hope you find joy in using them as much as I do.
Each package is meant to be standalone and does not have dependencies on other packages.

## Using the module

- Get the available versions of the module using `go list -m -versions github.com/tukaianirban/sdk.go.common`

- Fetch the latest version of the module using `go get github.com/tukaianirban/sdk.go.common`
